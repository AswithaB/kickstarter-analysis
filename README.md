outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.
Background
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.
